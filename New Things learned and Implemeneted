1. Through Some Videos other than my UDEMY course-work, Here,  I have implemented Token Invalidation at the time of User-Logout.
2. Storing JWT token in Local storage or to send through Headers is prone to XSS attacks and other Hacker attacks; So, to store JWT tokens in
    Cookie which is (HTTP-ONLY); not (LAX) is safe sometimes, which depends upon Project requirement.
3. As a single Token for Login Authorisation is prone to attack as even though if it expires, a sample of it exists which is prone to attack. 
    So, Solution is to create Access-token with shorter duration and a another token (Refresh token ) with Longer duration which is also stored in
    database and Cookie
4.  So, that Refresh token is used to generate Access token everytime it is expired. So, this is how hacker has no time left to hack a complete system. 
5. Need help of Front-end so thatto understand how front-end design is made .
